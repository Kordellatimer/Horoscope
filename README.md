## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I kept the HTML and CSS  simple. I and put an input for the user to type their desired birthdate, and a span to show the response to the user after they click the submit button. Then I added a event listener to button, so when the user clicks, it will take the date the user typed in the input and go through an if statement. Depending on the date, it will return the correct sign and description.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned more about if-statements. You can do a lot in the condition and as long as it is true, it will perform the action. Expanding my limits on what I could build.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
